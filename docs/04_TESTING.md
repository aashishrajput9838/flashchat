# Phase 4: Testing and Validation

## Overview

This document outlines the testing and validation phase for the FlashChat application after restructuring and refactoring.

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Test individual components in isolation
- Test service functions with mocked dependencies
- Test custom hooks with React Testing Library
- Test utility functions
- Aim for >80% code coverage

### Integration Testing
- Test feature modules together
- Test API integrations
- Test state management flows
- Test cross-feature interactions

### End-to-End Testing
- Test core user flows (login, chat, friend management)
- Test calling functionality
- Test notifications
- Test on different devices and browsers

### Performance Testing
- Measure load times
- Monitor bundle sizes
- Check for memory leaks
- Validate real-time functionality
