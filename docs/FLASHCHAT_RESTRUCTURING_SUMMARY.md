â”œâ”€â”€ docs/
â”œâ”€â”€ scripts/
â””â”€â”€ ...
```

### Documentation Created
1. Project structure overview
2. Codebase navigation guide
3. Contribution guidelines
4. ESLint and Prettier configuration

## Phase 2: Core Restructuring (Completed)

### Tasks Completed
1. Moved shared components to `src/shared/components/`
2. Created feature directories for auth, chat, user, and call
3. Moved related components, services, and hooks to appropriate features
4. Updated imports and references throughout the application
5. Cleaned up old directories

### Key Moves
- `avatar.jsx` and `online-status.jsx` â†’ `src/shared/components/`
- Authentication functionality â†’ `src/features/auth/`
- Chat functionality â†’ `src/features/chat/`
- User management â†’ `src/features/user/`
- Calling features â†’ `src/features/call/`
- Configuration files â†’ `src/config/`
- Utility functions â†’ `src/shared/utils/`

## Phase 3: Refactoring (In Progress)

### Custom Hooks Created
1. `useChat` - Handles chat-related state and functionality
2. `useUser` - Manages user authentication and profile data
3. `useCall` - Handles WebRTC calling functionality
4. `useOnlineStatus` - Manages online/offline status tracking
5. `useNotifications` - Handles notification management
6. `useTheme` - Manages application theme state

### Utility Functions Created
1. `timeUtils.js` - Time and date formatting functions
2. `mediaUtils.js` - Media device and stream handling
3. `errorUtils.js` - Error handling and user-friendly messages

### Component Refactoring
1. ChatThread component refactored to use `useChat` hook
2. Other components to be refactored to use appropriate hooks

## Phase 4: Testing and Validation (Planned)

### Testing Strategy
1. Unit testing for components, services, hooks, and utilities
2. Integration testing for feature interactions
3. End-to-end testing for user flows
4. Performance and security testing

### Tools and Frameworks
- Jest for unit testing
- React Testing Library for component testing
- Cypress for end-to-end testing
- Lighthouse for performance testing

## Phase 5: Documentation and Guidelines (Planned)

### Documentation to Create
1. Comprehensive project structure documentation
2. Contribution guidelines and coding standards
3. API documentation for services, hooks, and utilities
4. Architecture documentation
5. Deployment guide

## Phase 6: Implementation Plan (Planned)

### Phased Approach
1. Preparation (Completed)
2. Core Restructuring (Completed)
3. Refactoring (In Progress)
4. Testing and Validation (Upcoming)
5. Documentation and Guidelines (Upcoming)
6. Deployment and Monitoring (Upcoming)

### Timeline
- Total estimated duration: 20-25 days
- Resources: 3 frontend developers, 1 backend developer, 1 QA engineer, 1 DevOps engineer, 1 technical writer

## Phase 7: Feedback Loop (Planned)

### Feedback Collection Methods
1. Team feedback through retrospectives and code reviews
2. User feedback through surveys and analytics
3. Automated feedback through monitoring tools

### Continuous Improvement Process
1. Regular assessment of feedback processes
2. Experimentation with new approaches
3. Knowledge sharing and best practices
