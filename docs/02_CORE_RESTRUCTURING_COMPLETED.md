# Phase 2: Core Restructuring - COMPLETED

## Overview

This document summarizes the completion of the core restructuring phase for the FlashChat application, which involved organizing the codebase according to the new feature-based modular architecture.

## Summary of Changes

### 1. Shared Components
- Moved `avatar.jsx` and `online-status.jsx` to `src/shared/components/`
- Updated all imports to use the new paths

### 2. Feature-Based Organization
Created feature directories with their respective components and services:

#### Auth Feature
- Created `src/features/auth/` with services and components
- Moved authentication-related functionality

#### Chat Feature
- Created `src/features/chat/` with services and components
- Moved chat-related functionality including message handling

#### User Feature
- Created `src/features/user/` with services and components
- Moved user management and profile functionality

#### Call Feature
- Created `src/features/call/` with services and components
- Moved all WebRTC calling functionality

### 3. Configuration and Utilities
- Moved `firebase.js` to `src/config/`
- Moved `utils.js` to `src/shared/utils/`

### 4. Application Entry Point
- Updated `src/App.jsx` to use the new structure
- All imports now reference the new organized paths

### 5. Cleanup
- Removed old `src/components/` and `src/lib/` directories
- No broken imports or missing dependencies

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Improved Maintainability**: Code is now organized by feature, making it easier to locate and modify related functionality.

2. **Enhanced Scalability**: New features can be added following the established pattern without disrupting existing code.

3. **Better Separation of Concerns**: Each feature encapsulates its own components and services, reducing coupling between different parts of the application.

4. **Easier Testing**: Feature-based organization makes it simpler to write and run tests for specific functionality.

5. **Improved Collaboration**: Team members can work on different features with minimal risk of conflicts.

## Testing Results

The application was successfully tested after restructuring with:
- ✅ Authentication flow working correctly
- ✅ Chat functionality operational
- ✅ User profiles and settings accessible
- ✅ Calling features functional
- ✅ All components rendering properly
- ✅ No broken imports or missing dependencies

## Next Steps

Proceed to Phase 3: Refactoring to further improve the codebase structure and implementation.
