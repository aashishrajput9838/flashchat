## Issues Encountered

1. Some directories already existed, which caused minor issues during creation
2. File names were not consistent with component names (e.g., `video-call.jsx` instead of `VideoCall.jsx`)

## Next Steps

1. Update App.jsx to use the new structure
2. Test the application thoroughly
3. Clean up old directories
4. Document the new structure
