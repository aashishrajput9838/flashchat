# Phase 3: Refactoring

## Overview

This document outlines the refactoring phase for the FlashChat application, focusing on improving the codebase structure and implementation following the new feature-based modular architecture.

## Goals

1. Extract business logic into services
2. Create custom hooks for reusable logic
3. Implement proper state management
4. Refactor components to follow container/presentational pattern
5. Improve code quality and readability

## Refactoring Plan

### 1. Extract Business Logic into Services

#### Chat Service Improvements
- Extract message formatting logic from ChatThread component
- Move timestamp formatting to chatService
- Create utility functions for message status handling

#### User Service Improvements
- Extract user data transformation logic
- Create helper functions for user status management
- Move friend list processing to userService

#### Call Service Improvements
- Extract WebRTC initialization logic
- Create helper functions for call status management
- Move ICE candidate handling to callService

### 2. Create Custom Hooks

#### useChat Hook
- Handle message subscription and state management
- Manage message sending functionality
- Handle chat selection logic

#### useUser Hook
- Manage user authentication state
- Handle user profile updates
- Manage friend requests and notifications

#### useCall Hook
- Handle WebRTC connection setup
- Manage call status and state
- Handle media device management

#### useOnlineStatus Hook
- Manage online/offline status tracking
- Handle user activity monitoring
- Manage privacy settings for online status

### 3. Implement Proper State Management

#### Chat State
- Centralize chat-related state in a context or store
- Manage selected chat, messages, and typing indicators
- Handle chat list filtering and search

#### User State
- Centralize user-related state including profile and settings
- Manage friend lists and friend requests
- Handle notifications and alerts

#### Call State
- Centralize call-related state including connection status
- Manage media streams and devices
- Handle call history and logging

### 4. Refactor Components

#### Container/Presentational Pattern
- Separate data fetching and business logic (containers) from UI rendering (components)
- Create presentational components for reusable UI elements
- Move state management to container components

#### Component Structure Improvements
- Break down large components into smaller, focused components
- Create reusable UI components in shared directory
- Implement proper prop drilling or context usage

### 5. Code Quality Improvements

#### Error Handling
- Implement consistent error handling across services
- Add proper loading states and user feedback
- Handle edge cases and network failures gracefully

#### Performance Optimization
- Implement memoization for expensive calculations
- Optimize re-renders with React.memo and useMemo
- Use lazy loading for components and routes

#### Code Documentation
- Add JSDoc comments to functions and components
- Document complex logic and algorithms
- Create README files for each feature directory

## Implementation Steps

1. Create custom hooks for each feature
2. Extract business logic from components to services
3. Implement state management solutions
4. Refactor components to follow container/presentational pattern
5. Add error handling and loading states
6. Optimize performance
7. Add documentation

## Timeline Estimate

- Custom hooks: 4 hours
- Business logic extraction: 6 hours
- State management: 4 hours
- Component refactoring: 8 hours
- Error handling and optimization: 4 hours
- Documentation: 2 hours

Total estimated time: 28 hours

## Testing Strategy

- Unit test custom hooks
- Test service functions with mocked dependencies
- Test refactored components with React Testing Library
- Perform integration testing of features
- Validate performance improvements

## Next Steps

Begin implementing custom hooks for each feature.
