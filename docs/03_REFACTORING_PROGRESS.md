## Issues Encountered

1. Some hooks have overlapping functionality that needs to be consolidated
2. Need to ensure proper cleanup of event listeners and subscriptions

## Next Steps

1. Begin refactoring components to use the new hooks
2. Extract business logic from components to services
3. Implement state management solutions
4. Add error handling and loading states
5. Optimize performance
6. Add documentation
