# Week 1: Fix Current Firestore Implementation

## Overview
This week focused on fixing the current Firestore implementation to ensure real-time messaging works properly in the FlashChat application.

## Issues Identified
1. **Nested onSnapshot calls**: The original implementation had nested `onSnapshot` calls which could cause duplicate subscriptions and memory leaks.
2. **Inefficient message sorting**: The message sorting was inefficient and could cause UI flickering.
3. **Missing optimization**: No mechanism to prevent unnecessary state updates when messages haven't changed.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed subscribeToMessages Function
- Replaced nested `onSnapshot` calls with a single efficient query
- Used a single query with `where` clauses to get messages between both users
- Simplified the subscription logic to prevent memory leaks

### 2. Improved useChat Hook
- Added message comparison logic to prevent unnecessary state updates
- Implemented a reference to track previous messages
- Only update state when messages have actually changed

### 3. Enhanced Conversation List
- Added subscription to latest messages to update conversation previews in real-time
- Created `subscribeToLatestMessages` function to track the most recent message for each conversation
- Updated conversation list to display latest message previews

### 4. Added Comprehensive Tests
- Created unit tests for chat service functions
- Added tests for the useChat hook
- Implemented tests for error handling scenarios

## Testing
All changes were tested to ensure:
- Real-time message updates work correctly
- Memory leaks are prevented
- UI performance is improved
- Error handling works properly

## Results
After implementing these fixes, the real-time messaging functionality should now work properly without requiring page refreshes. Users should see new messages appear instantly as they are sent by other users.
