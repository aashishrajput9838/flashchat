# FlashChat Self-Call Prevention Feature

## Feature Description
Implemented functionality to prevent users from making video or audio calls to themselves, which would be an invalid operation.

## Issue
Users could accidentally initiate calls to their own chat, which would create a confusing user experience and potentially cause technical issues with the WebRTC connection.

## Solution
Added validation checks in both the [startVideoCall](file:///c:/Users/aashi/OneDrive/Desktop/flashchat_new/src/components/chat-thread.jsx#L106-L126) and [startAudioCall](file:///c:/Users/aashi/OneDrive/Desktop/flashchat_new/src/components/chat-thread.jsx#L128-L148) functions in [chat-thread.jsx](file:///c:/Users/aashi/OneDrive/Desktop/flashchat_new/src/components/chat-thread.jsx) to compare the selected chat user ID with the current user ID. If they match, an alert is shown and the call is prevented.

## Implementation Details

### Video Call Prevention
```javascript
// Prevent users from calling themselves
if (selectedChat.uid === user?.uid) {
  alert("You cannot make a video call to yourself.");
  return;
}
```

### Audio Call Prevention
```javascript
// Prevent users from calling themselves
if (selectedChat.uid === user?.uid) {
  alert("You cannot make an audio call to yourself.");
  return;
}
```

## Verification Steps
1. Log in to FlashChat as a user
2. Navigate to your own chat (if accessible)
3. Attempt to initiate a video call
4. Verify that an alert message appears: "You cannot make a video call to yourself."
5. Attempt to initiate an audio call
6. Verify that an alert message appears: "You cannot make an audio call to yourself."
7. Navigate to another user's chat
8. Verify that calls can still be initiated normally

## Impact
This change improves the user experience by:
- Preventing invalid self-calls
- Providing clear feedback when users attempt invalid operations
- Reducing potential technical issues with WebRTC connections
- Maintaining consistency with user expectations
