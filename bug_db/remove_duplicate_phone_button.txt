# FlashChat Duplicate Phone Button Removal

## Issue Description
The video call interface had two Phone (end call) buttons:
1. One in the header (top right corner)
2. One in the call controls (bottom center)

This created a redundant UI element that could confuse users.

## Root Cause Analysis
During the development of the video call interface, a Phone button was added to the header for quick access to end calls. However, a complete set of call controls including an end call button was also implemented in the bottom section, making the header button redundant.

## Solution Implementation
Removed the Phone button from the video call header while keeping the comprehensive call controls in the bottom section. The bottom call controls include:
- Mute/Unmute button
- Video on/off button
- Screen share button
- End call button (Phone icon)

## Code Changes
Modified [video-call.jsx](file:///c:/Users/aashi/OneDrive/Desktop/flashchat_new/src/components/video-call.jsx) to remove the Phone button from the header section:

```jsx
{/* Call header */}
<div className="flex items-center justify-between p-3 border-b border-gray-700">
  <div className="min-w-0 flex-1">
    <h3 className="text-responsive-lg font-semibold truncate">{chatTitle}</h3>
    <div className="flex items-center gap-2">
      <p className="text-responsive-sm text-muted-foreground truncate">{callStatus}</p>
      {callStatus === 'Call in progress' && (
        <span className="text-responsive-sm font-medium text-green-500">
          {formatCallDuration(callDuration)}
        </span>
      )}
    </div>
  </div>
  {/* Removed the Phone button from header since we have one in the call controls */}
</div>
```

## Verification Steps
1. Start a video call between two users
2. Verify that there is no Phone button in the header
3. Verify that the call controls at the bottom still include the end call button
4. Test that the end call functionality works properly from the bottom controls
5. Confirm that the UI is cleaner and less cluttered

## Results
- Eliminated UI redundancy
- Maintained all functionality
- Improved user interface clarity
- Consistent with user preference for a single, clearly positioned end call button
