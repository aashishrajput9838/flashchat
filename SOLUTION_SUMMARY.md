4. Verified Firestore operations work with proper error handling
5. Confirmed application works even when Firestore is temporarily unavailable
6. Verified real-time chat functionality with proper user identification
7. Tested chat selection including self-chat functionality
8. Verified high quality profile pictures are displayed
9. Confirmed messages are stored with readable IDs in Firestore
10. Verified messages are properly ordered chronologically in the application
11. Tested message ordering fallback mechanisms
12. Verified profile avatars display correctly in all messages

## Running the Application

1. Start the backend server:
   ```
   cd backend
   node index.js
   ```

2. Start the frontend:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

The application should now work without the connection errors and display real Gmail names and chat history instead of dummy data. Profile pictures will now be displayed in high quality, and messages in Firestore will have readable IDs in the format [timestamp]_[first_5_words_of_message]. Messages are properly ordered chronologically in the application interface, and profile avatars should display correctly for each message sender. Clicking on user profiles in the conversation list or right sidebar will now replace the current chat section with that user's chat section, maintaining consistent sizing and positioning.
