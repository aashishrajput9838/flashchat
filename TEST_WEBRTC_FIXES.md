# WebRTC Fixes Testing Guide

## How to Test the WebRTC Fixes

### 1. Start the Development Server
The server is already running at http://localhost:5173/

### 2. Test ICE Candidate Handling
- Open two browser windows and navigate to the app
- Log in with different users
- Initiate a video call between the users
- Check the browser console for the following:
  - No "_delegate undefined" errors
  - ICE candidates are properly added to Firestore
  - No warnings about invalid ICE candidates

### 3. Test Duplicate Offer/Answer Prevention
- Monitor the console logs during call establishment
- Verify that you don't see "Offer already handled, skipping" or "Ignoring duplicate offer" messages
- Ensure each offer/answer is processed only once

### 4. Test Signaling State Management
- Verify that signaling state transitions are consistent
- Check that the call establishes properly without state conflicts
- Confirm that calls can be ended cleanly from both sides

### 5. Test Resource Cleanup
- End a call and verify that all resources are properly cleaned up
- Check that Firestore listeners are unsubscribed
- Confirm that media streams are stopped
- Verify that peer connections are closed

## Expected Results

After implementing the fixes, you should see:
- No ICE candidate errors in the console
- No duplicate offer/answer warnings
- Stable signaling state transitions
- Proper resource cleanup when calls end
- Improved call connection reliability

## Console Output Verification

Look for these positive indicators in the console:
- "ICE candidate added to Firestore successfully"
- "Set remote description from answer"
- "Call in progress"
- "Cleaning up media resources"
- "Cleaning up listeners"

And ensure these errors no longer appear:
- "TypeError: Cannot use 'in' operator to search for '_delegate' in undefined"
- "Offer already handled, skipping"
- "Ignoring duplicate offer"
- "Remote video waiting/buffering" (should be minimal)

## Cross-Browser Compatibility

Test the fixes in multiple browsers:
- Google Chrome
- Microsoft Edge
- Mozilla Firefox

All browsers should show consistent behavior with no errors.
